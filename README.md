Project Challenge
Malama Maunalua, a non-profit, needs a better way to get, store, and visualize information about their Adopt-a-Plot program.

Project Proposal
Our team will be creating an application for families that adopt plots of land to take care of in the Maunalua Bay, our app will allow families to upload what they did each day, how much algae they removed, how long it took, etc.
